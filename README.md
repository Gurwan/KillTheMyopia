<p>Kill The Myopia is a way to fight against a disease affecting more and more people, particularly in the field of developers: myopia. 
This script is a simple timer that triggers a visual and audible alert every twenty minutes to prompt you to take a short 5-minute break from work or entertainment. This pause must be made without screen to be optimal. 
This twenty-minute interval between each break is recommended by health professionals. 
If you want to participate in improving this script you are welcome. </p>
